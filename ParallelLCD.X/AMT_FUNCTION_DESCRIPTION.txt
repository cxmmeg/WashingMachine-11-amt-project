SOME GENERAL POINTERS:

This is for the PARALLEL LCD, the LCD AT THE BACK.

You MUST wait for the function to fully execute before it goes to the next line of code

PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE RUN the main.c if you want to understand how to fully
utilize the P_LCD.c and P_LCD.h files.

To create a char array ( c [] ) and call the function:
eg.

char message [] = "This is a message";
P_LCD_scroll_vertical(message);

If you think this library is not versatile enough 
1. Go and make yourself 
2. I don't want to hear it

FUNCTION DESCRIPTION

THESE FUNCTIONS SHOULD NOT BE USED AND WERE CREATED TO BE USED INTERNALLY 
WITHIN THE P_LCD.c MODULAR STRUCTURE:
(if you use these functions it means the functions below these ones 
doesn't fit your needs for some reason)

void Pause_ms(int x); 
Delays by (x*1) millisecond (ms)

void Pause_us(int x);
Delays by (x*40) microseconds (us)

void P_LCD_send_byte(char c, int msg_or_cmd, int fast_or_slow)
Sends byte to Parallel LCD
msg_or_cmd: 0 = send command byte
msg_or_cmd: 1 = send message byte
fast_or_slow: 0 = is set slow (120ms) 
fast_or_slow: 1 = is set fast (3us)
if set to command mode, it will automatically toggle fast mode

IGNORE ALL FUNCTIONS ABOVE

THESE FUNCTIONS ARE THE ONES YOU SHOULD BE USING:

void P_LCD_init(void); 
Initialize Parallel LCD

FUNCTIONS TO SET CURSOR:

void P_LCD_set_cursor(int on_or_off)
on_or_off: 1 = turn on cursor
on_or_off: 0 = turn off cursor

void P_LCD_cursor(int top_or_bottom)
Sets cursor to either top or bottom line
top_or_bottom: 1 = top line
top_or_bottom: 2 = bottom line

FUNCTION TO SEND MESSAGE TO EITHER TOP, BOTTOM OR BOTH LINES:

void P_LCD_send(char c[], int top_or_bottom);
Sends a message smaller than 15 chars to the Parallel LCD
top_or_bottom: 1 = top line
top_or_bottom: 2 = bottom line

void P_LCD_send_all(char c[]); 
Sends the entire message to the first line, if message char amount > 16, 
sends to second line, if even the second line cannot display the full contents, 
nothing will happen

FUNCTIONS TO CLEAR EITHER TOP, BOTTOM OR BOTH LINES:

void P_LCD_CLR(int row);
Clears the screen
row: 0 = clear both rows
row: 1 = clear only the top row
row: 2 = clear only the bottom row

FUNCTION TO SCROLL A MESSAGE VERTICALLY ON BOTH LINES:

void P_LCD_scroll_vertical(char c[]);
Scrolls char array message downwards

FUNCTION TO SCROLL A MESSAGE HORIZONTALLY ON ONE LINE:

void P_LCD_scroll_horizontal(char c[], int top_or_bottom);
Scrolls a message horizontally sideways
char c[] = Enter char array message here
top_or_bottom: 1 = scroll message on top line
top_or_bottom: 2 = scroll message on bottom line

FUCTION TO FLASH A MESSAGE THAT IS SMALLER THAN 16 CHARS:

void P_LCD_flash(char c[], int time, int top_or_bottom);
Flashes a message that is <= 16 chars
top_or_bottom: 1 = flashes a message on the top line 
top_or_bottom: 2 = flashes a message on the bottom line
